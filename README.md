Search for certain things in certain subreddits. This site does nothing more than what a basic Google search using search operators. Ex. if I wanted to find good quality headphones on /r/buyitforlife, I would simply type: "headphones site:reddit.com/r/buyitforlife" to use the power of both Reddit AND google search to get good results.

However should you wish to use this website I will not stop you from doing so.
